# Hi, there üëãüèº

I'm Anja, 40 years old, currently living between Hamburg and Bremerhaven and just finished the Web Development Bootcamp at neue fische - school and pool for digital talents.

In 12 very intense weeks we learned an incredible amount, e.g. JavaScript, React, HTML5, CSS3, Node.js, Github Workflow, Storybook, Styled Components, Test Driven Development and basics of UX/UI design and agile project management.

Now I am looking forward to deepening all this new, exciting knowledge.

## What I did before the Bootcamp at neue fische

The Internet fascinated me already in the days of the 28K modem. So, armed with a simple text editor and selfHTML, I built my first small personal website. I placed special emphasis on implementing my very clear idea of how my site should be structured, and on a consistent and aesthetic appearance. During my apprenticeship in a small advertising agency I built my first websites for state and federal parliament members with the help of Joomla and a good friend (as backup). 

Later, in my further professional career, my fascination for structure and aesthetics was joined by my enthusiasm for haptic, analog media (print production). Here, too, I was driven by the motivation to want to know exactly how the technology behind it worked (from the use of graphics programs to the printing processes and quality assurance). And so, for several years, I organized print products ranging from small special prints to large POS and OOH campaigns.

To my delight, the paths of analog and digital media crossed more and more in recent years. Since then, it is always a great pleasure for me when I get the chance to coordinate cross-media or digital projects as well. If you look at the print market, you can clearly feel that the market for print products is shifting significantly in its relevance and that this area is also becoming more and more digitally driven.

In view of this development and the opportunities that digitalization offers in many areas, I now wanted to dive back into the digital world and learn a skill (web development) in order to be able to optimally meet future requirements.
